== How does it work? ==

With this plugin, you can easily mint your existing or new products into collections of NFTs or Fungible tokens with just a few clicks. The system will automatically pick up metadata from your products and generate a valid JSON structure. Bakrypt's API will mint the object as a Cardano native token according to your preferences.  Once the transaction is confirmed, the fingerprint of the minted NFT is linked to the product in your store. You can also create QR codes of the fingerprint! Go to your products list, select your minted products and select "Create QR Codes" from the bulk actions dropdown.

The plugin also has the ability to upload images and documents into IPFS using Bakrypt's IPFS node. Product thumbnail images will automatically be picked as the cover image for NFTs, and these will be uploaded at the time of minting. Once the transaction has been submitted, Bakrypt will generate a transaction with an estimated cost and a deposit address. Once payment is confirmed on the deposit address, Bakrypt will go ahead and mint the tokens in the Cardano blockchain. Following the minting process, any remaining tokens (ADA) and assets will be sent back to the sender's address. Refunds are offered for _non-confirmed_ transactions. It's important to note that Bakrypt's convenience fees are _non-refundable_ for transactions that have been confirmed.

The plugin implements WordPress native cron tasks; the plugin will automatically pull asset data (every 3 minutes until the transaction is confirmed or canceled), into your WordPress store and update your store products. The metadata includes the transaction's submitted JSON metadata as seen in the blockchain, policyId, fingerprint, and status. This metadata is used in several places in WordPress, such as printing the fingerprint of a minted asset in the order's email that the customer receives, which improves the traceability of the product and increases trust in the store.

== Non-Fungible Tokens as a supply chain solution ==

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are digital assets that represent ownership of a unique item or concept. They are stored on a blockchain and can be bought, sold, and traded like any other asset.

One potential use case for NFTs within a supply chain is to track the ownership and movement of goods as they pass through various stages of production, distribution, and sale. For example, an NFT could be created for each batch of raw materials that enter a manufacturing facility, and then updated with information about where those materials were used and what products they were used to create. This could help companies track the origin and history of their products, and make it easier to trace them back to their source in the event of a recall or other issue.

NFTs could also be used to verify the authenticity of products, by linking them to a unique digital asset that represents the product's provenance. This could be particularly useful for high-value items such as luxury goods or art, where counterfeiting is a concern.

Overall, the use of NFTs in a supply chain could help companies improve transparency, traceability, and authenticity, which could in turn enhance customer trust and loyalty.

== Cardano Blockchain ==

Cardano is a decentralized public blockchain and cryptocurrency project that is focused on providing a secure and scalable platform for the creation and use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
